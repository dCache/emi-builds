Probes for (emi) Grid services. To be used with Nagios.

Grid services covered:
- SRM

The code is written in Python and uses 'python-GridMon' Python package, which is
provided by python-GridMon >= v1.1.12 RPM.

The most up-to-date version that was currently available from here:

http://rpm.hellasgrid.gr/mash/centos6-egi-sam/x86_64/

With older versions one will run into the problem that SL6 standard python is 2.6
and older python-GridMon packages require python 2.4.
