If you want to conenct a jenkins swarm client very quickly just execute the following line assuming 
the swarm client jar can be found under /home/jenkins/ ( That you downloaded from :
http://maven.jenkins-ci.org/content/repositories/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/swarm-client/ )

(you have to replace the place holders with the appropriate values, ask for name and passwd)
java -jar /home/jenkins/swarm-client-1.8-jar-with-dependencies.jar -master http://svn.dcache.org/build -fsroot <someDirectory> -name <client FQAN> -labels <label-name> -username <name> -password <passwd>


To use the here provided script follow this:

1.) Put the jenkins-swarm-connect into /etc/init.d/
2.) Create the jenkins user: useradd jenkins
3.) Get the most up-to-date swarm client jar that includes dependencies from:

     http://maven.jenkins-ci.org/content/repositories/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/swarm-client/

    Save the jar to some path and provide the script with the path by setting this variable:

     JENKINS_SWARM_JAR=/home/${USER}/swarm-client-1.<????>-jar-with-dependencies.jar

4.) Adjust some of the parameters in the file to your needs:

     NODE_NAME="svn.dcache.org"
     JENKINS_HOST=http://svn.dcache.org/build
     USER=jenkins
     JENKINS_LABLES=xen-emi-wn
     JENKINS_ROOT=/home/${USER}/.jenkins
     JENKINS_OUT=/var/log/jenkins
     JENKINS_ERR=/var/log/jenkins.err
     JENKINS_SWARM_JAR=/home/${USER}/swarm-client-1.8-jar-with-dependencies.jar
     JENKINS_SYS_USER=<please fill in>
     JENKINS_SYS_PASS=<please fill in>

    Ask someone of the dCache team what is the JENKINS_SYS_USER and JENKINS_SYS_PASS to fill into the file.

5.) execute: /etc/init.d/jenkins-swarm-connect start
6.) To make the jenkins client reconnect after reboot of your machine execute: chkconfig jenkins-swarm-connect on
7.) chkconfig --list jenkins-swarm-connect #should show you that the service will now be activated at the appropriate run level
